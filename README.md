# Java-based-implementation-of-Generic-Stack-and-Deque-data-structures

This is an Java 8 based implementation of generic Deque and Stack data structures. The Deque class has been implemented using Java arrays and uses a growable circular array formulation. The Stack interfaces uses the deque implementation.
